 * The bridge between assistant-ui and AgentCore's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
 *
 * AgentCore keeps the transcript on the server and names the call in the `X-AgentCore-Session`
 * header. assistant-ui, like every OpenAI client, is stateless and sends the whole message list
 * instead. Holding the session id here — in the browser, for the life of the tab — is what
 * reconciles the two, and it is what saves AgentCore from needing a server-side map from chat
 * thread to call.
 *
 * Everything that touches the wire lives in {@link ./transport.ts}, where it is tested. This file
 * is the React shape around it and nothing else.
